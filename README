This program tries to recreate a reference image using a randomly-colored and
randomly-generated polygon.  This can take a very long time, depending on the
reference image used!

This is intended to be run using a small PNG reference image (200px x 200px
seems to work well).

Output images will be placed in the out/ directory.
